# Contributing to RoverForge

Thanks for your interest! A few guidelines to keep contributions smooth:

- Fork the repository and open pull requests against `main`.
- Keep PRs focused and include a clear description of changes.
- Add or update tests where appropriate.
- When editing code, follow the project's `.editorconfig` rules.
- For larger features, open an issue first to discuss design.

Code style

- Python: follow PEP8. Use `black` or `flake8` if adding new Python files.
- Arduino/C++: keep functions small and well-documented.

Reporting bugs

Open an issue with steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and any relevant logs.
