# RoverForge

RoverForge is a modular robot project scaffold for the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi + a Raspberry Pi controller. It includes motor control, ultrasonic sensing, and a simple web UI for teleoperation.

This repository is a starter template — expand the `lib/` and `pi_control/` components as you add features.

Quick start

1. Compile/upload the Arduino sketch in `motor_controller/` with the provided Makefile.
2. Optionally run the Pi webserver in `pi_control/` to get a browser-based remote control.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for design notes and wiring guidance.
